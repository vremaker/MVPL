      <h1> Meet Night Owl </h1>
      <p>
        This project spanned 11 weeks in our HCDE 318 (Introduction to User
        Centered Design) course, in Autumn 2019. As a team of 4, we applied
        the user centered design process to the problem area of the danger
        of walking alone at night for students. The process culminated in a
        mobile application called NightOwl that gives students confidence and
        control when walking alone at night.

    <h2> Interviews </h2>
    <p>
      Our research consisted of three different methods: semi-structured
      interview, “fly on the wall” observation, and competitive analysis.
      Through these methods, we learned more about our user group and their
      goals and pain points as well as other products already on the market.

      <br/> <br />
      Each team member conducted a one-on-one interview with a student at the
      University of Washington that walks during dusk or at night at least
      4 times a month. We then regrouped and synthesized our findings into
      key takeaways that would help us define our problem space and user group.
      <ul>
        <li>They felt more comfortable talking with a friend on the phone when walking alone </li>
        <li>Walking home alone is unavoidable </li>
        <li>They know about UW safety, but doesn’t know how it works</li>
        <li>They are very aware of their surroundings </li>

      Each team member conducted one competitive analysis on an existing safety
       app. This allowed us to understand how existing products on the market meet
       users’ needs and how they could be improved. We analyzed the apps BSafe,
       Circle of 6, Sekura, and Noonlight. Overall, the apps all had streamlined
       designs that generally made users feel safe, but also had shortcomings
       such as confusing features and allowing users to easily trigger emergency
       services on accident. We used this information to seek opportunities,
       inspire our designs, and learn what to avoid.

      From our interviews, we gathered key insights on our users that we
      compiled into categories such pain points, desires, and goals. These
      helped us create personas grounded in data in order to avoid stereotypes
      and assumptions. We chose to create two personas: one that was more
      experienced with the UDistrict area and one that was only semi-familiar
      with the area. This let us understand different user perspectives. Our
      personas were a home base that we frequently visited to realign our
      product and goals to our users’ needs.

      Our user journey map represents the experience of Amanda, one of our users,
      while walking home at night. We captured key touch points between her and
      her environment and emotions throughout her walk home. We focused on
      anxiety, alertness, and confidence as the emotions we wanted to track,
      because they were the most prevalent emotions of our interviewees. This
      journey map helped us understand our user’s feelings and interactions while
      walking home.

    <p>
      After better understanding our users and problem space through research,
      we defined design requirements that outlined the functions of our application.
      These requirements ensured that our solution solved user pain points
      and satisfied their goals. In addition, they helped us decide to focus on
      creating a phone app as our final product because it would be able to
      fulfill the requirements. This would also be convenient for our users
      since we observed that many of them interacted with their phone in some
      way while walking at night.

    <h2> Information Architecture </h2>
    <p>
      After deciding to make an app as our product, we started brainstorming
      key features that would be the most helpful to our users. We utilized our
      design requirements and user personas when ideating the app’s features and
      how users would go through a specific task for a feature. Overall, our
      information architecture showed the relationships and flows between
      each feature. This set us up for success as we started ideating and
      creating paper prototypes of our app screens.

  <!--Paper prototypes-->
  <div id="pp" class="page">
    <h2> Paper Prototypes</h2>
    <p>
      The paper prototypes were a quick, easy way to test our designed features
       without distracting users with colors and shapes. They helped us
        pinpoint confusing and unintuitive aspects of our initial features,
        which we incorporated into our redesign. First, we each individually
        sketched and described three interfaces. Then, we came back together
        and combined our rough draft sketches into consistent interface sketches
        for our usability tests. Based on our storyboards and information
        architecture diagram, we defined three key tasks that we asked users
        to complete in our tests.
      </p>
      <p>
      Task 1: User searches for a final destination, which will be home.
      Then they will select the path that they want to take and start their
      route.
      <br />
      Task 2: User reports a burglary incident and inputs the correct
      information (date, time, description) and submits it. After submitting,
      check that it was successfully added to the map.
      <br />
      Task 3: User adds new safety contact and then calls them.
      <br />

    </p>
    <h3>  Try these tasks yourself with our virtual prototype </h3>
    <iframe id="high" src="https://marvelapp.com/5dga7h4?emb=1&iosapp=false&frameless=false" width="350" height="350" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>
      Participants: We tested our prototype with four female University of
      Washington students who walk alone at night at least once a week.
      <br />
      Method: For each evaluation, we followed three major phases of testing in order to cohesively gather quality information about our users and our app. The first phase started off with an interview with each participant in order to gather basic demographic information. The second phase consisted of the main usability testing by providing users with a task that they had to accomplish while observers recorded notes. During the test, we asked participants to think out loud so that we could better understand their thought process and pain points. To make it seem like a real application, we used a Marvel App to conduct our usability testing. Lastly, we performed a post test interview to get final details of what participants thought of their experience of our solution to night safety.
After individually completing our usability tests, we came back together to synthesize and analyze our findings. We found commonalities in the features users struggled with, strengths and weaknesses of our design, and suggestions for redesign.

Key Findings:
Users wanted to be able to share their location with safety circle even when they have not started a path.
Users did not expect the app to immediately call after clicking on the contact. Some expected they would be able to edit the contact information.
Users want to be able to quickly input information when reporting a hazard because they could be in a dangerous situation when they are reporting it.
Users stated that hazards have different urgency levels, and this should be reflected in the app.

    <h2> Annotaed Wire Frames </h2>
    <p>
      	Also based on our usability testing feedback, we redesigned and
        added aspects to our wireframes. Then, looking back at our information
        architecture, we created the app's full functionality in Figma. These
        wireframes were supposed to be low fidelity without color and real
        text in order to strictly communicate the app’s features. We annotated
        each screen to highlight key components and describe functionality.
        This step helped us think about how our features worked together and
        was a useful way to get feedback before designing our high fidelity
        prototypes.

      <h2> High Fidelity Prototype </h2>
      <p>
        Based on all our research and testing, we created an app called NightOwl,
       that students could use to feel safe when walking alone at night.
       The app has two main components: safety circle and map.
       <br />
        In the safety circle, based on interviewees stating they feel
        comfortable when they’re walking and talking to their friend,
        users are able to quickly and easily call their friends. If their
        friends are busy, users can call the bot. The bot will record and
        talk to them, mimicking a ‘friend’ listening to you in case your
        are in a dangerous situation.
        <br />
        On the map, users can select a destination and the safest path to get
        there. Once the user starts their route, their safety contacts will be
        alerted and the app will automatically send another notification when
        the user gets to their final destination; this happens automatically
        because it’s easy to forget to let your friends know you got home safe.
        To keep the incidents up to date on the map, we use crowdsourcing;
        users can report and confirm hazards. After user feedback, we made
        the SOS button be easily clickable, which brings up a popup that
        counts down from 5 seconds and then calls 911. If the user accidently
        pressed the SOS button, they can easily cancel it. But we learned
        that it’s important the SOS be button be very quick to use in case
        of a dire situation.
        <br />
        For our colors, we chose dark mode because users would be using this
         app at night, so we wanted the screen to be subdued. Our color scheme
         was dark blue, bright orange, and bright red. It was important to create
         high contrast to show key information. Orange represents important
         actionable items such as reporting a hazard and starting route.
         The bright red is used only for the SOS button to ensure it stands
         out in case of emergency.

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <p>
      Overall, this project was challenging and definitely stretched our
      thinking in both design and teamwork. Working with a group to create
      a high-fidelity mockup for a product in just 11 weeks was difficult
      and required hard work from everyone. We learned that designing with a
      team requires clear and effective communication, compromise, and a lot
      of dedication. With that being said, we’re all proud of our final product
      and enjoyed every step of the design process.
      <br />
      <em> Outline of what we would do: </em>
      <ul>
        <li> More user research and usability testing  </li>
        <li>
          Explore optimizing map pathfinding for users going between the
          same two places multiple times a week
       </li>
     </ul>
     If we had more time, we definitely would have conducted more user research
     and usability testing. Specifically, it would have been useful to do
     competitive analysis on other technologies and services rather than just
     apps. Also, although a phone app fit our design requirements,
     we didn’t have much time to think about alternative forms of our
     final product. We definitely would’ve wanted to explore other options,
     especially since our user group of students walking at night should
     actually be discouraged from using their phones.
     <br />
     In addition, there were parts of our app that we want to test more
     because we are unsure of their effectiveness or usefulness. One of
     these functions is the SOS button; we had gotten a lot of feedback about
     how to make it easily accessible while not making it easy to accidentally
     trigger. Based on a few user feedback, we were able to incorporate a solution
     into our final design, but we would want to test with more users. However,
      it was difficult to actually test the true functionality of the SOS
      button because it’s meant to be used in emergency situations. Another
      feature that we were unsure about was the ability to call a Bot. Some of
      our users said that they would feel weird talking to a Bot and wouldn’t
      use it, while some said they would. With more time, we would’ve wanted
      to figure out how to make this feature truly useful to our users.
      <br />
      One really interesting question we received was about our research
      into how often our users were going between the same two points every
      week, and how we can optimize our map function to those users. This
      question was very thought-provoking; since one of our features was
      pathfinding on a map, we immediately turned to pre-existing solutions
      (e.g. Google Maps, Apple Maps) as a base. However,
      these solutions are made to deal with someone starting
      from anywhere and going to anywhere. Dealing with the situation of
      users going between the same two points multiple times a week might
      result in a completely different solution. If we had the time, we would
      want to explore this concept of optimization for this specific situation.

      <br />
Finally, here are some key takeaways from each of us:
	Maya: At the end of the project, I was surprised by how much a “final” design can still be improved. It was a little disheartening seeing how much critique our (almost) final design received, but when I thought about it, pretty much every design in the world can be improved in some way.
  <br />
	Lia: I learned how to optimize time and create quality work by understanding and using each team mate’s skills and passions. At different steps in our process, each one of us went above and beyond to help the project excel.
